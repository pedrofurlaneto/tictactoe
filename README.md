# Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses)
This project showcases my implementation of the classic game in the C programming language. It was originally developed as part of an academic assignment, with a focus on optimization techniques and data structures.

## Game Description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where the objective is to fill a 3x3 grid with symbols (usually “X” and “O”) in such a way that a complete row, column, or diagonal contains the same symbol. Players take turns until one wins or a draw occurs.

## Features
- Game Board: The program creates a 3x3 grid for the game.
- Player Alternation: Players alternate between “X” and “O.”
- Win Condition Check: The program verifies if a player has won (by completing a row, column, or diagonal) or if it’s a draw.
- Coordinate Input: Players input coordinates (row and column) to make their moves.

## How to Run 
Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
Execute the generated program.
Input coordinates (row and column) to make your moves.
